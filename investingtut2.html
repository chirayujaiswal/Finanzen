            <h3>What Is Stock Market??</h3>
            <p>Just like the way we go to the neighbourhood Kirana store or a supermarket to shop for our daily needs,
                similarly, we go to the stock market to shop (read as transact) for equity investments. The stock market
                is where everyone who wants to transact in shares goes to. The main purpose of the stock market is to
                help you facilitate your transactions. So if you are a buyer of a share, the stock market helps you meet
                the seller and vice versa</p>
