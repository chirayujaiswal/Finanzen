            <h1>FUNDING</h1>
            <h3>Introduction (What is funding?) </h3>
            <p>Funding is the act of providing resources to finance a need, program, or project. While this is usually in the form of money, it can also take the form of effort or time from an organization or company. Generally, this word is used when a firm uses its internal reserves to satisfy its necessity for cash, while the term financing is used when the firm acquires capital from external sources. </p>

            <p>Sources of funding include credit,  venture capital, donations, grants, savings, subsidies, and taxes. Fundings such as donations, subsidies, and grants that have no direct requirement for return of investment are described as "soft funding" or "crowdfunding". </p>
            <h3>  (Why funding is required): </h3>
            <p>It has been shown that the amount of funding and resources committed to an area directly affect the development, quality, and services related to the area. For example, the funding given to education is directly related to the quality of education and academic achievement. Therefore, we can conclude two things: firstly, funding is needed to improve products, services, and technologies and secondly, it is only beneficial if regulations are in place to ensure that the funds are used appropriately to maximise their value. </p>
