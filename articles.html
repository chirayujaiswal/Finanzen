            <h1 class="secondary"> The Golden Rule:</h1>
            <p>The golden rule of investing as follows:-</p>
            <div class="q center"><strong><em>“The higher the risk, the higher the return.”</em></strong></div>
            <p>In other words, the higher the risk, the higher the return an investor would claim as compensation for
                taking the risk. So, when a low-risk investment is made, the return is going to be low as well and vice
                versa.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            <h1 class="secondary">There are two truths we’d like to stress to you at this point:</h1>
            <p>One is the fact that taking the time to acquire even a very rudimentary knowledge of investing, whether
                at
                sixteen or sixty, will put you well ahead of your peers in terms of financial literacy, and ultimately,
                in
                terms of financial success.</p>
            <p>The second truth comes from one of the richest commodity futures traders. This wise, older man confided
                an
                important “secret” about investing and wealth .</p>
            <div class="q center"><strong><em>“You can make a lot more money a lot faster by sending your money
                        to work for you every
                        day, rather than just sending yourself to work every day.”</em></strong></div>

            <h1 class="secondary">Buffett’s Two Rules of Investing…</h1>
            <div class="q center" style="padding: 10px;"><strong><em>"Rule No. 1: Never lose money. <br> <br> Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No.1”</em></strong></div>
            <p>But, it is possible for the stock market to price things wrong! You can find wonderful businesses on sale often</p>
            <div class="q center"><strong><em>“Remember that the stock market is a manic depressive.”</em></strong></div>
            <p>For any consumer of daily financial news, this will ring true. Equity markets swing wildly from day to day on the smallest of news, rally, and crash on sentiment, and celebrate or vilify the most inane data points. It’s important not to get caught up in the madness. Instead, stick to your homework.</p>
