            <h1>Insurance</h1>
            <h3>What is Insurance?</h3>
            <p>Insurance is a contract, also referred to as a policy, where an individual is protected from financial
                losses by an insurance company. In order to receive protection, the company will require you to pay a
                fee called a premium. In return, you will be provided with a sum of money if you come across an incident
                where you suffer financial losses, and the premium you pay covers the incident.</p>

            <h3>Common Terms</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Policy: </dt>
                <dd>A legal agreement between the insured and insurer. It is also referred to as a contract that
                    specifies which events or scenarios that you will be covered for and how much compensation or
                    benefits the insurer will pay the insured individual.</dd>
                <dt> Policy limit: </dt>
                <dd>The maximum amount of compensation that an insurer will pay the insured individual, only if the
                    event that instigated financial losses is covered and specified in the policy.</dd>
                <dt> Policyholder: </dt>
                <dd> The individual who holds the policy with an insurer. In most cases, the policyholder is usually the
                    insured.</dd>
                <dt> Insured: </dt>
                <dd>The individual who is offered protection by a policy.</dd>
                <dt>Insurer: </dt>
                <dd>The insurance company that offers a policy to protect insured individuals.</dd>
                <dt> Deductible: </dt>
                <dd>A specific amount of money the policyholder needs to pay for a financial loss before the insurer
                    covers the rest.</dd>
                <dt> Premium: </dt>
                <dd>The amount that individuals must pay in order to receive coverage to protect financial losses. A
                    premium is also referred to as the price of the policy.</dd>
                <dt> Grace period: </dt>
                <dd>After an individual purchases insurance, a specific amount of time is given to the individual in
                    which he/she is allowed to cancel the policy for a full refund of premiums. The grace period varies
                    by different insurers because some companies could offer a few days, while other companies could
                    offer a few weeks.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h3>How Does Insurance Work?</h3>
            <p>The insurer determines the amount of premium that the insured person must pay based on the risk that the
                insured events will occur. Different people will be subject to varying amounts of risks for different
                events. For example, a new driver who is recently issued a driverâ€™s license will need to pay more
                premium for car insurance in comparison to an experienced driver.</p>
            <p>The premiums that insured individuals pay are grouped together with the premiums that others pay for an
                insurance company. The pooled money is then used as compensation for insured individuals if they need
                coverage for financial losses.</p>
