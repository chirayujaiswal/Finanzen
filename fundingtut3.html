            <span>Bank Loans – </span>
            <div class="points">Having good credit history is very important in obtaining a bank loan to fund a business. Your credit history provides the financial lenders with an idea of your ability to pay off debts. Most banks require you to provide a business plan that should reflect the products and services of your business as well as your company mission. The plan also should include financial predictions to allow lenders to see how your company will be able to come up with sufficient income to settle loan payments.</div>
            <span>Government Grants and Loans- </span>
            <div class="points">The government can provide capital for a business in the form of a grant. A grant usually is designed to promote economic growth or to instigate research for a particular industry. Options will vary depending on the industry. Another funding method is through micro loans from local government agencies. As its name suggests, micro loans are small loans to help you get your business going. Non-profit organizations provide services aimed at helping entrepreneurs and boosting the growth of the local economy.</div>
