            <p class="left"> The main purpose of the stock market is to help you facilitate your transactions. So
                if you are a buyer of a share, the stock market helps you meet the seller and vice versa.Savings are
                kept in the form of cash or cash equivalents (e.g. as bank deposits), which are exposed to no risk
                of loss but also come with correspondingly minimal returns.Savings comprise the amount of money left over after spending. People may save for various life goals or aspirations such as retirement, a child's college education, the down payment for a home or car, a vacation, or several other examples.

        <div class="tut" id="tut2">
            <p class="right"> Funding is the act of providing resources to finance a need, program, or project.
                While this is usually in the form of money, it can also take the form of effort or time from an
                organization or company. Generally, this word is used when a firm uses its internal reserves to
                satisfy its necessity for cash.Funding is the money that lenders and equity holders provide to a business for daily and long-term needs. A company's funding consists of both debt (bonds) and equity (stock). The business uses this money for operating capital. The bond and equity holders expect to earn a return on their investment in the form of interest, dividends, and stock appreciation

            <p class="left">Investing is the act of allocating resources, usually money, with the expectation of
                generating an income or profit. You can invest in endeavors, such as using money to start a
                business, or in assets, such as purchasing real estate in hopes of reselling it later at a higher
                price.Investing can be a daunting prospect for beginners, with an enormous variety of possible assets to add to a portfolio.The investment "risk ladder" identifies asset classes based on their relative riskiness, with cash being the most stable and alternative investments often being the most volatile.

        <h1 class="secondary right">Insurance</h1>
        <div class="tut" id="tut4">
            <p class="right">Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which an individual or entity
                receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company. The company
                pools clients' risks to make payments more affordable for the insured. The amount that you pay for
                this arrangement is called premium. The most common types of personal insurance policies are auto,
                health, homeowners, and life. Most individuals in the United States have at least one of these types of
                insurance, and car insurance is required by law.
